  THE INSTALLATION PROCESS AND USING THE SOFTWARE OR LICENSE KEY. IT PROVIDES 
  A LICENSE TO USE THE SOFTWARE, A LICENSE TO USE LICENSE KEYS, AND CONTAINS WARRANTY 
  INFORMATION AND LIABILITY DISCLAIMERS. BY INSTALLING AND USING THE SOFTWARE 
  OR LICENSE KEY, YOU ARE CONFIRMING YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THE SOFTWARE OR LICENSE

<p>1. Definitions</p>
<p>(a) &quot;DynaBEAN&quot; means DynaBEAN Consulting and its licensors, if any. </p>
<p>(b) &quot;Software&quot; means only the DynaBEAN software program(s) and third 
  party software programs, in each case, supplied by DynaBEAN herewith, and corresponding 
  documentation, associated media, printed materials, and online or electronic 
  documentation. </p>
<p>(c) &quot;License Key&quot; means a program supplied by DynaBEAN separately

<p>(d) &quot;Trial License Key&quot; means a version of a License Key, so identified, 
  to be used only to review, demonstrate and evaluate the Software for a limited 
  time period. Software used with a Trial License Key may have limited features, 
  may lack the ability for the end-user to save the end product, and will cease 
  operating after a predetermined amount of time due to an internal mechanism 
  within the Trial License Key and the Software. </p>
<p>2. License Grants </p>
<p>(a) You may install and use the Software on multiple computers; OR install 
  and store the Software on a storage device, such as a network server, used to 
  install the Software on your other computers over an internal network. </p>
<p>(b) You may install and use a License Key on a single computer; OR install 
  and store the License Key on a storage device, such as a network server, used 
  only to install the License Key on your other computers over an internal network, 
  provided that you have a license for each separate computer on which the License 
  Key is installed. A License Key for the Software may not be shared, installed 
  or used concurrently on different computers. </p>
<p>(c) You may make copies of the Software in machine-readable form. You must 
  reproduce on any such copy all copyright notices and any other proprietary legends 
  on the original copy of the Software. </p>

  for backup purposes. You must reproduce on any such copy all copyright notices 
  and any other proprietary legends on the original copy of the License Key. </p>
<p>(e) You agree that DynaBEAN may audit your use of the Software and/or License 
  Keys for compliance with these terms at any time, upon reasonable notice. </p>
<p>(f) Your license rights under this EULA are non-exclusive. </p>

  reverse engineer, disassemble, or reduce the Software to a human-perceivable 
  form. </p>

  sole purpose of determining whether to purchase a license to a commercial License 
  Key.</p>
<p>(h) Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may install or use a Trial License Key 
  for &nbsp;training purposes, only if each trainee enters into a EULA or you 
  obtain written permission from the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Technology 
  Officer of DynaBEAN to do so.</p>
<p>(i) You may receive the License Key in more than one medium but you shall only 
  install or use one medium. Regardless of the number of media you receive, you 
  may use only the medium that is appropriate for the server or computer on which 
  the License Key is to be installed. </p>

  termination).</p>

  WITHOUT ANY LICENSE KEY APPLIED ARE PROVIDED &#147;AS IS&#148; AND, FURTHER, 
  THERE IS NO WARRANTY OF NON-INFRINGEMENT AS TO EITHER OF THESE. </b></p>
<p><b>(c) EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN THE FOREGOING LIMITED WARRANTY WITH RESPECT TO 
  THE SOFTWARE WITH A LICENSE KEY WHICH IS NOT A TRIAL LICENSE KEY APPLIED, DynaBEAN 
  AND ITS SUPPLIERS DISCLAIM ALL OTHER WARRANTIES AND REPRESENTATIONS, WHETHER 
  EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY 
  OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. ALSO, THERE IS NO WARRANTY OF NON-INFRINGEMENT 
  AND TITLE OR QUIET ENJOYMENT. DynaBEAN DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE IS

<p><b>(d) IF APPLICABLE LAW REQUIRES REGARDLESS OF CONTRACTUAL TERMS TO THE CONTRARY 
  ANY WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE OR A LICENSE KEY, ALL SUCH WARRANTIES 
  ARE LIMITED IN DURATION TO NINETY (90) DAYS FROM THE DATE OF DELIVERY.</b></p>
<p><b>(e) NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY DynaBEAN, ITS DEALERS,

  SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. THIS WARRANTY GIVES YOU SPECIFIC 
  LEGAL RIGHTS AND YOU MAY ALSO HAVE OTHER LEGAL RIGHTS THAT VARY FROM STATE TO 
  STATE, REGARDLESS OF CONTRACTUAL TERMS TO THE CONTRARY. PLEASE CHECK YOUR LOCAL 
  LAWS FOR ANY RESTRICTIONS OR LIMITATIONS REGARDING THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED 
  WARRANTIES</b>.</p>
<p>7. Exclusive Remedy</p>
<p>Your exclusive remedy under the preceding is to return the License Key to the 
  place you acquired it, with a copy of your receipt and a description of the 
  problem. Provided that any non-compliance with the above warranty is reported 
  in writing to DynaBEAN no more than ninety (90) days following delivery to you, 
  DynaBEAN will use reasonable commercial efforts to supply you with a replacement 
  copy of the License Key and the Software that substantially conforms to the 
  documentation, provide a replacement for defective media, or refund to you your 
  purchase price for the License Key, at its sole option. DynaBEAN shall have no 
  responsibility if the License Key or the Software has been altered in any way, 
  if the media has been damaged by misuse, accident, abuse, modification or misapplication, 
  or if the failure arises out of use of the License Key or the Software with 
  other than a recommended hardware and software configuration. Any such misuse, 
  accident, abuse, modification or misapplication of the License Key or the Software 
  will void the warranty above. THIS REMEDY IS THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY AVAILABLE

  KEY, THE SOFTWARE AND RELATED DOCUMENTATION.</p>

  YOUR LOCAL LAWS FOR ANY RESTRICTIONS OR LIMITATIONS REGARDING THE LIMITATION

<p>The Limited Warranty and Disclaimer, Exclusive Remedies and Limitation of Liability 
  set forth above are fundamental elements of the basis of the agreement between 
  DynaBEAN and you. DynaBEAN would not be able to provide the Software on an economic 
  basis without such limitations. Such Limited Warranty and Disclaimer, Exclusive 
  Remedies and Limitation of Liability inure to the benefit of DynaBEANs licensors.</p>

  EULA do not affect or prejudice the statutory rights of a consumer, i.e., a 
  person acquiring goods otherwise than in the course of a business.</p>
<p>The limitations or exclusions of warranties, remedies or liability contained 
  in this EULA shall apply to you only to the extent such limitations or exclusions 
  are permitted under the laws of the jurisdiction where you are located. </p>
<p>11. General</p>
<p>This EULA shall be governed by German law, without giving effect to 
  principles of conflict of laws. You hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction

  or understandings, whether oral or written. You agree that any varying or additional 
  terms contained in any purchase order or other written notification or document 
  issued by you in relation to the Software licensed hereunder shall be of no 
  effect. The failure or delay of DynaBEAN to exercise any of its rights under 
  this EULA or upon any breach of this EULA shall not be deemed a waiver of those 
  rights or of the breach. </p>
<p>No DynaBEAN dealer, agent or employee is authorized to make any amendment to 
  this EULA. </p>
<p>If any provision of this Agreement shall be held by a court of competent jurisdiction

  permissible, and the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in full

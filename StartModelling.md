## Creating a secondary diagram ##

when we have a large database model, for example one that was loaded from an existing database, it may be useful to partition the model into several diagrams that each show a particular detail of the model.

In the following video, we start out with a big model for which we have created one diagram which shows all tables an relationships. Clearly, it is hard to overlook the whole picture. We therefore proceed to create a second diagram in which we only show certain details pertaining to the Employee entity.
  * Note how table relationships pointing to entities outside the current diagram are depiected with a little rectangle outside the top corner of a table figure.
  * Note also how the referenced tables are shown when you hover the mouse pointer over the little rectangle:

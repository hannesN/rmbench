<h1><span style="font-weight: bold;">Printing</span></h1>
<p>Printing is an important feature for a modelling tool, as many users
will want to produce paper copies of the diagrams. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">RMBench</span> supports this requirement in
two ways:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>during design, you can switch on the display of a page outline
for each diagram. The outline will show the extent of the printable
page (depending on the selected printer). This serves as printing
preview and&nbsp; allows the user to place figures within page
boundaries for better printing results</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>we provide a specialised printer dialog that adds all the usual
features expected in an industrial-strength application</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<br>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<p>Note that currently (as of version 3.1) the Eclipse print support is
not implemented on all platforms. In particular, on Linux/GTK systems,
you
will find the <span style="font-style: italic;">print</span> item in
the <span style="font-style: italic;">file</span> menu, and the
print-related menu items in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Diagram</span>
menu, disabled. As we depend on the Eclipse engine for the grunt work,
we cannot get around this restriction. Linux/GTK users should instead
consider the export facilities that will create file formats printable
through other applications<br>
</p>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<h2>Page Outline<br>
</h2>
<p>You can switch on the page outline by checking the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Page Outline</span> item in the Diagram
menu. When you do this for the first time, you will see the Printer
Setup dialog<br>
</p>
<p><img alt="printer setup" src="../../images/PrinterSetup.png"
 style="width: 222px; height: 165px;"><br>
</p>
<p>As the printable page size depends on the printer in use, you have
to choose the printer and the margin settings for page outline
computation. These settings will be saved with the current diagram for
the duration of the user session, and can be changed at any time using
the <span style="font-style: italic;">Printer Setup</span> item in the
<span style="font-style: italic;">Diagram</span> menu.<br>
</p>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<p>Note that settings made in this dialog only serve the purpose of
computing the page outline. When you later print the diagram, you will
again be able to set these same properties, along with several other
values not related to page outline. Needles to say that if you change
these settings during printing, the results will not be the same as
presented in the page outline.<br>
</p>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<h2>Printer Settings</h2>
<p>When you choose the <span style="font-style: italic;">Print</span>
item from the <span style="font-style: italic;">File</span> menu while
a <em class="UILabel">RMBench</em> diagram is active, you will see the
Printer Settings dialog<br>
</p>
<p><img alt="printer settings" src="../../images/PrinterSettings.png"
 style="width: 278px; height: 346px;"><br>
</p>
<p>This dialog provides all the usual settings for a print dialog. You
can revise your choice of the target printer and the margin. Note that
if you use these facilities, the print results may deviate from the
page outline displayed in the diagram.<br>
</p>
<p>The <span style="font-style: italic;">Print Settings</span> dialog
also provides the following <span style="font-style: italic;">Mode</span>
options<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Tile. Print the diagram pages without scaling according to the
page outlines computed for the current printer, using the current margin<br>
  </li>
  <li>Fit Page. Before printing, scale the image such that it fits on
one page.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Fit Width. Before printing, scale the image such that the
horizontal extent is one page only<br>
  </li>
  <li>Fit Height. Before printing, scale the image such that the
vertical extent is one page only</li>
</ul>

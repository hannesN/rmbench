<h1>Extension points</h1>
<p><em>RMBench</em> uses the eclipse mechanisms to allow for extending the base functionality.
For this purpose, it provides a number of extension points that can be used e.g. to add native 
database mappings, JDBC drivers, and code generators. <em>RMBench</em> itself uses these extension 
points to provide reference implementations. Where these implementations are not sufficient for
a given purpose, it sould be easy to amend them.</p>
<p class="Note">In case that you develop some extension that might also serve other users of <em>RMBench</em>,
we would be happy to consider integrating it into the main code base, thus ensuring future maintenance
and compatibility. <a href="mailto:info@byterefinery.com">Contact us</a> to negotiate an appropriate recompensation</p>

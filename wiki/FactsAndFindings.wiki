== Importing tables with user-defined data types (UDTs) ==
in MS SQLServer, when importing table metadata from tables with columns that reference UDTs, these columns are _not_ returned unless the current user has the required privileges. Thus, it may happen that a table appears to only have 2 columns, while in fact it has more. This can lead to model save errors if there are, e.g., indexes that reference these columns.

In my case, adding the db_owner role to the user that performs the import fixed the problem.

First we need a model that we can import into. As with any resource maintained in eclipse, we also need a project that the model can be stored into. If you dont already have one, you can create the project the usual eclipse way. It does not matter what kind of project this is.

After that, we create a new diagram and pull the contents of one database catalog into the new diagram for graphical display:

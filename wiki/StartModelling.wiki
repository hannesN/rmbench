Here we will demonstrate how modelling RMBench works

== Creating a secondary diagram ==

when we have a large database model, for example one that was loaded from an existing database, it may be useful to partition the model into several diagrams that each show a particular detail of the model.

We therefore proceed to create a second diagram in which we only show certain details pertaining to the Employee entity. 
  * Note how table relationships pointing to entities outside the current diagram are depiected with a little rectangle outside the top corner of a table figure. 
  * Note also how the referenced tables are shown when you hover the mouse pointer over the little rectangle:

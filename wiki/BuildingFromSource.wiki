= Building RMBench from source =

This page is a first attempt at describing the build process.


= Details =

The RMBench build system is currently not in a good shape, as it targets only eclipse 3.3 and my particular environment. This is partly due to the imperfect PDE tools, which, at least at the time when I last studies them, were generating build files with hard-coded paths. All this may have changed in the meantime, but I havent had time to investigate. Therefore, our build system is the first item on the TODO list.
